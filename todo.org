** DONE Remove usage of exceptions

If we have more monad-like result structure we can do away with exceptions.

        r[spec] = spec.from(env)
      rescue Failure => e
        r[spec] = e

[[file:~/Developer/env_parser/lib/env_parser/parser.rb::r\[spec\] = spec.from(env)
 rescue Failure => e
 r\[spec\] = e]]
** DONE Simplify multiple args to use just a single for target

We're not going to use descriptions anyway so we might as well simplify this.

[[file:~/Developer/env_parser/lib/env_parser/parser.rb::def required(name, *args, allow_blank: true, &block)]]
** DONE Raise aggregate error

When we check for the final results, collect all errors and then raise one aggregate error summarising everything that is wrong.
